    <h2>üí´ About Me:</h2>
 
Hi, I'm Dhiraj Karangale, a Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience building scalable, secure, and responsive web applications using React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Java.

I specialize in modern frontend development leveraging React (Hooks, Redux Toolkit, React Query) to create clean, intuitive, and responsive user interfaces using Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and Bootstrap.
On the backend, I design and implement efficient RESTful APIs, ensure secure authentication using JWT, and work proficiently with both NoSQL and SQL databases.

With a solid foundation in Java backend development and strong problem-solving skills, I bring a versatile approach to full stack development. As a HackWithInfy Finalist, I have a proven competitive edge and a commitment to code quality and performance.

Beyond web development, I've developed multiple Android apps that have collectively reached over 160K+ downloads on the Play Store, demonstrating my ability to deliver high-impact, real-world solutions.
